# Explonatory Data Analysis on Election data in R
The file used contains data for 3080 respondents to the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey conducted in April 2020. The data includes “feeling thermometer” measurements for various public figures. Respondents give a score from 0 to 100 for the figure, where 0 indicates “very cold” and 100 indicates “very warm.” (A value of more than 100 denotes a missing value and should be omitted.) The feeling thermometer scores for four Presidential candidates: Joe Biden (variable ftbiden1), Donald Trump (fttrump1), Bernie Sanders (ftsanders1), and Pete Buttigieg (ftrbuttigieg1) is analyzed. In addition, concerns over COVID-19 were also important in 2020’s elections. One of the questions asked in the pilot study was “How worried are you personally about getting the coronavirus (COVID-19)?” The responses, recorded in the variable covid1, were coded numerically:
• 1: Extremely worried
• 2: Very worried
• 3: Moderately worried
• 4: A little worried
• 5: Not at all worried
• 9: (missing value)
